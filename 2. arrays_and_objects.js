 * Exercise: Creating arrays and objects
In this exercise lab you will practice creating arrays and objects.

Tasks to complete
Create a new empty array literal and assign it to the variable clothes.

Add 5 of your favorite items of clothing as strings using the push() method.

Remove the fifth piece of clothing from the array using the pop() method.

Add a new piece of clothing using the push() method.

Use console.log to show the third item from the clothes array in the console.

Create a new empty object literal and assign it to the variable favCar.

Using the dot notation, assign a color property to the favCar object and give it a string value with the color of your choice.

Using the dot notation, assign a covertible property to the favCar object and give it a boolean value of your choice.

Use the console to log the entire favCar object.
